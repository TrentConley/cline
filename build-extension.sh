# Build Extension - Script for building and packaging the VSCode extension.

# This script does the following:
# 1. Builds the webview UI.
# 2. Compiles the extension TypeScript code.
# 3. Packages everything into a single .vsix file for installation.
#
# It assumes all dependencies are already installed.
# Run './install-fresh.sh' first if you are on a new machine.

# Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.
